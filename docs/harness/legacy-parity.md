# Legacy Harness Parity (D-25)

The user-level gate layer at `~/.claude/{bin,lib}` (gate-ci, gate-verify, gate-perf,
harness-resolve + lib/harness.mjs, 486 lines, June 2026) is the incumbent harness for
Tim's repos (aitutor, kickpool, nrl-predictor). **This project replaces it** (Tim,
2026-07-05). Rule: no legacy feature is dropped without an explicit decision; the
`harness.json` schema stays compatible so bound repos need no rebinding.

## Feature inventory → parity status

Status: ✅ present in new harness · 🔜 planned (milestone noted) · 🆕 new-harness improvement over legacy

### Resolver (`lib/harness.mjs`)

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| `findProjectRoot`: walk-up for `.claude/harness.json`, fallback git root | 🔜 port as-is (M-parity) |
| Autodetect Node/Next.js: lint/typecheck/build/test from npm scripts; placeholder-`test` exclusion; boot/ready for Next | 🔜 port as-is |
| Autodetect Python: ruff/mypy/pytest from pyproject; `.venv/bin` preference; tests-dir heuristic | 🔜 port as-is |
| Autodetect Python + Next frontend subdir (`frontend/web/client/app`) | 🔜 port as-is |
| Autodetect SAM/Lambda (`template.yaml` → sam build/local, localstack) | 🔜 port as-is |
| Explicit binding overlays defaults; absent key ⇒ gate no-ops (never a bogus command) | 🔜 port as-is — this contract is the heart of the design |

### gate-ci

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| lint + typecheck + test; `--full` adds build; aggregate failures, run all steps | 🔜 becomes `harness/gates/ci.mjs`; the loop's `ci` gate consumes it (today run-live shells npm directly — interim only) |
| `--force` + source-changed guard (git porcelain, source-extension filter) so the Stop hook is near-free | 🔜 port as-is |
| Stop-hook protocol: stdin JSON, `stop_hook_active` loop guard, exit 2 + stderr feedback | 🔜 port as-is; Stop hook re-pointed at new path at cutover |
| — | 🆕 new: every gate run emits a JSONL event (task/cost/duration attribution) — legacy has no telemetry |

### gate-verify

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Mock adapters `dynamodb-local`/`localstack` (compose up/down + readiness port 8000/4566); `mockUp`/`mockDown` overrides | 🔜 port; extensions.md adds Testcontainers as the successor pattern, adapters kept for compatibility |
| `setup` step; `env` merge | 🔜 port as-is |
| Boot as detached process group; log-file capture; `tail -40` on failure; kill process tree + mock down on exit/SIGINT; `--keep` | 🔜 port as-is |
| HTTP readiness (`ready` + `readyMatch` substring) | 🔜 port as-is |
| `acceptance` + `observability` steps against the live app | 🔜 port; o11y step later deepens per extensions.md (OTel signal checks) |

### gate-perf

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| No-op without `perfBoot`/`perfRoutes`; `perfReady`/`perfReadyMatch`/`perfBase`/`perfEnv`/`perfBaseline` defaulting chain | 🔜 port as-is (M-parity, lower priority — no repo currently binds perf keys) |
| Warmup 3 + N samples (`--samples`, default 40); p50/p95; **median-gated** budget `base×1.5 + 10ms` (p95 shown, not gated); machine-noise guidance | 🔜 port as-is — the median-gating rationale is documented and correct for a dev machine |
| `--update` baseline rewrite; committed baseline file with note/timestamp | 🔜 port as-is |
| Boot-death detection during readiness wait | 🔜 port as-is |

### harness-resolve

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| `--json` / `--root` / `<key>` inspection CLI | 🔜 port as-is |

## What the new harness already adds beyond legacy

Role-based guardrail hooks (protect-paths, bash-guard) · two-agent TDD loop with
verified RED and D-11 escalation · TDD Guard integration (aitutor pattern) · JSONL
event telemetry with cost capture · GitHub outer loop (required checks, tamper-proof
guard, labels) · review-chain design · OpenSpec change bundles · decisions register.

## Migration plan (M-parity milestone, before any legacy retirement)

1. Port `lib/harness.mjs` → `harness/gates/resolve.mjs` unchanged (plus unit tests —
   legacy has none 🆕).
2. Port the three gates into `harness/gates/`, each emitting JSONL events (🆕),
   behavior otherwise identical; `harness.json` schema unchanged.
3. Loop controller's `ci` gate delegates to the ported gate-ci (removes run-live's
   inline npm shelling).
4. Repoint the Stop hook: `~/.claude/settings` Stop → `harness/gates/ci.mjs`
   (needs the harness repo path resolvable from any repo — ship as a small npm-linked
   bin or absolute path).
5. Cutover check per bound repo (aitutor, kickpool, nrl-predictor):
   `gate-ci --force --full` and `gate-verify` produce the same verdicts via old and
   new paths.
6. Only then: legacy `~/.claude/{bin,lib}` files replaced with forwarding shims (one
   release), then removed.
